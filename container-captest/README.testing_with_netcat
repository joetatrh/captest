Included in this container is a "demonstration-ready" copy of netcat,
to which the Linux capability net_bind_service has been granted.

This "demo" netcat validates whether you have the net_bind_service capability.

If this special copy of netcat lets you listen on a low-numbered port without
becoming the root user, then the capability has carried into this container.

EXAMPLE DEMOS:

1. Inspect the capabilities on the "normal" and "demo" copies of netcat.
   The "normal" one doesn't have any capabilities; the "demo" netcat has the
   net_bind_service capability.

```
$ filecap /usr/bin/ncat
$ 

$ filecap /opt/captest/bin/nc.with.net_bind_service
set       file                 capabilities
effective /opt/captest/bin/nc.with.net_bind_service     net_bind_service
````

2. Confirm that the "normal" netcat doesn't let non-root users bind to port 23.

```
$ whoami
captest

$ /usr/bin/nc -l 127.0.0.1 23
Ncat: bind to 127.0.0.1:23: Permission denied. QUITTING.
```

3. Repeat the "listen-on-port-23-test" using the "demo" netcat binary.
   Now you can bind to this low port, even without being the root user.

```
$ whoami
captest

$ /opt/captest/bin/nc.with.net_bind_service -l 127.0.0.1 23 &
[1] 32

$ echo "this text is being sent to port 23" | /usr/bin/nc 127.0.0.1 23
this text is being sent to port 23
[1]+  Done    /opt/captest/bin/nc.with.net_bind_service -l 127.0.0.1 23
```
